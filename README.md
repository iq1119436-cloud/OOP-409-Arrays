#  Arrays

An **array** is a data structure that stores a collection of elements of the **same data type** in **contiguous memory locations**.  
Each element in an array is accessed using an **index number**, which starts from **0**.

Arrays are used when multiple values of similar data types need to be stored and processed efficiently.

---

##  Characteristics of Arrays

- All elements in an array must be of the **same data type**
- Memory is allocated **contiguously**
- Each element is accessed using an **index**
- Array size is usually **fixed** at the time of declaration
- Arrays provide **fast access** to elements

##  Types of Arrays

### 🔹 One-Dimensional Array (1D Array)

A one-dimensional array stores data in a **single linear sequence**.  
It is similar to a **list of elements**.

**Uses:**
- Storing marks
- Names
- Prices

---

### 🔹 Two-Dimensional Array (2D Array)

A two-dimensional array stores data in **rows and columns**, forming a **table or matrix**.  
Each element is accessed using **two indices** (row and column).

**Uses:**
- Student result sheets
- Tables
- Matrices

---

### 🔹 Three-Dimensional Array (3D Array)

A three-dimensional array stores data in **multiple layers of 2D arrays**.  
Each element is accessed using **three indices**.

**Uses:**
- Game development
- Image processing
- Scientific calculations

---

##  Advantages of Arrays

- Efficient storage of multiple values
- Fast access using index numbers
- Easy traversal using loops
- Simple and structured data management

---

##  Disadvantages of Arrays

- Fixed size (cannot grow dynamically)
- Wastage of memory if size is not fully utilized
- Insertion and deletion are difficult
- Stores only homogeneous data (same type)

---

##  Applications of Arrays

- Data processing
- Searching and sorting algorithms
- Mathematical operations
- Database-like structures

---

##  Summary

Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures in programming.  
They provide fast and efficient data access but have limitations such as fixed size and lack of flexibility.
