Arrays

An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type in contagious memory locations.
Each element in an array is accessed using a index numbers, which starts from 0.
Arrays are used when multiple values of similar data types need to be stored and processed efficiently.

Characteristics
1)	All elements in an array must be of the same data type.
2)	Memory is allocated contiguously.
3)	Each element is accessed using an index.
4)	Array size is usually fixed at the time of declaration.
5)	Arrays provide fast access to elements.

Types of Arrays
One-Dimensional Array (1D Array)
A one-dimensional array stores data in a single linear sequence.
It is similar to a list of elements.
Uses:
•	Storing marks
•	Names
•	Prices

Two-Dimensional Array (2D Array)
A two-dimensional array stores data in rows and columns, forming a table or matrix.
Each element is accessed using two indices (row and column).
Uses:
•	Student result sheets
•	Tables
•	Matrices

Three-Dimensional Array (3D Array)
A three-dimensional array stores data in multiple layers of 2D arrays.
Each element is accessed using three indices.
Uses:
•	Game development
•	Image processing
•	Scientific calculations


Advantages of Arrays
1)	Efficient storage of multiple values.
2)	Fast access using index numbers.
3)	Easy traversal using loops.
4)	Simple and structured data management.


Disadvantages of Arrays
1)	Fixed size (cannot grow dynamically).
2)	Wastage of memory if size is not used fully.
3)	Insertion and deletion are difficult.
4)	Stores only homogeneous data (same type).

Applications of Arrays
1)	Data processing
2)	Searching and sorting algorithms
3)	Mathematical operations
4)	Database-like structures
